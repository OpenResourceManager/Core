The [Universal User Data](https://gitlab.sage.edu/groups/UniversalUserData) project's goal is to provide a means to manage and maintain institutional data in a way that is accessible across any language that can utilize HTTP/HTTPS.
In order to achieve this goal, the [Universal User Data API](https://gitlab.sage.edu/UniversalUserData/UniversalUserDataApi) has been created. The API leverages [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) standards through the Laravel PHP framework.
